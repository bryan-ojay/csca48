# CSCA48: Introduction To Computer Science II

This repository contains all my finished (and some unfinished) code from my activity in the CSCA48 course at the University of Toronto, Scarborough Campus. In this repository are all of my assigments and exercises from the course, with documentation in context to the course projects.
All of the work in this repository was coded in Python 3.5.2 or higher.

## Assignments

The Assignments folder contains the main projects assigned for completion, aslong with the created test files for each assignment.
The prompt for each of these assignments mainly focused on recursive functions as well as object oriented programming, working with generic objects such as Stacks, Queues and Trees, represented objects created in Python. Each assignment was completed over the course of 2-3 weeks.

## Exercises 

The Exercises Folder contains the assigned weekly homework questions, along with the created test files for each given exercise. 
The prompts for each of these exercises allowed us to work with different forms of recursive functions and objects including Containers and Trees. Each exercise was completed over the course of 3-4 days.

## Lecture Files

The Lecture Files folder contains some of the files used as examples during the lectures in CSCA48. The majority of these files were used to aid in the assignments and exercises.
